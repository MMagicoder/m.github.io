## INTRODUCTION 

Administrators must protect company assets and ensure people have proper access to resources. One way to do that is to ensure that volunteers can easily find and complete their tasks, even if they cannot create a Google account. By following the steps above, you can ensure that your volunteers have a way to communicate, collaborate, and complete their work. 
This short how-to guide helps information administrators at nonprofit organizations create volunteer email addresses for volunteers. In-house, company-controlled emails ensure every volunteer has access to the resources they need to collaborate and complete tasks and allow administrators can fully monitor and control access. 

### Benefits of setting up a volunteer email login 

There are several advantages to using in-house emails besides control and guaranteed access. 

Here is a brief list of the benefits of creating and assigning in-house email addresses.

+ Eliminates the need for volunteers to sign up for a (different) Google account 
+ Ensures volunteers have a way to view or update internal documents
+ Administrators can change passwords to ensure that only current volunteers can access documents or other resources
+ Administrators can delete email addresses if necessary
+ Safety: Administrators can be sure that documents do not run malicious code
* Centralized version control: Administrators can monitor all changes to documents and restore them if necessary

In the next section, we will review the process of creating a volunteer email address that will allow temporary staff members to access company assets.

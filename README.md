> I have a dream, and you're watching me make it a reality.

# Welcome to my little corner of the Internet!

This is my first technical writing blog. I built it on GitHub to showcase my skills, namely my writing, self-editing, research, collaboration, and technological abilities. Modern technical writers and developers must use various tools to communicate with segmented audiences. I am comfortable using several content management systems, including, but not limited to Confluence, WordPress, Drupal, and GitHub. 

I have diverse experience across several industries and collaborate with people from all over the world.
Thanks to a solid education and array of experience, I can quickly turn my new insights into actionable steps for leaders, juniors, and the general public.
